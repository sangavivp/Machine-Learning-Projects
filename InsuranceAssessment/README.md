# Project Description

To build a predictive model to classify the risk for a Insurance Applicant.

I have given an overview of this project [here](http://bit.ly/2GAnhVE_InsuranceProj).

## Background Information

In a one-click shopping world with on-demand everything, the life insurance application process is antiquated. Customers provide extensive information to identify risk classification and eligibility, including scheduling medical exams, a process that takes an average of 30 days.
The result? People are turned off. The company wants to make it quicker and less labor intensive for new and existing customers to get a quote while maintaining privacy boundaries.

So, I have developed a predictive model that classify risk using a more automated approach, and enable company and customers to opt of an insurance policy at the earliest.

## Data Description

Over a hundred variables describing attributes of life insurance applicants. "Response" is an ordinal measure of risk that has 8 levels is the target variable.

__Continous Variables__:
Product_Info_4, Ins_Age, Ht, Wt, BMI, Employment_Info_1, Employment_Info_4, Employment_Info_6, Insurance_History_5, Family_Hist_2, Family_Hist_3, Family_Hist_4, Family_Hist_5

__Discrete Variables__:
Medical_History_1, Medical_History_10, Medical_History_15, Medical_History_24, Medical_History_32

__Categorial Variables(Nominal)__:
The rest of the variables are in this category

Medical_Keyword_1-48 are dummy variables.

## Models Built:

  * Logistic Regression
  * Decision Tree
  * Random Forest
  * Cross Validation
