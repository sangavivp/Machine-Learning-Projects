# Project Description

In a one-click shopping world with on-demand everything, the life insurance application process is antiquated. Customers provide extensive information to identify risk classification and eligibility, including scheduling medical exams, a process that takes an average of 30 days.
The result? People are turned off. The company wants to make it quicker and less labor intensive for new and existing customers to get a quote while maintaining privacy boundaries.

So, I have developed a predictive model that classify risk using a more automated approach, and enable company and customers to opt of an insurance policy at the earliest.



OPTIMIZATION:
Factorization instead of Dummification
