# Machine Learning Projects
## Repository Overview
I project my Machine Learning work here. Every project has a detailed description and jupyter notebook.
The projects have resuable python code to reduce the effort on recurring problems.
 ## Project List
 * [Effect of Economy on Olympics Medals](#project1)
 * [Loan Borrower Classification](#project2)
 * [Car Sales Prediction](#project3)
 * [Bank Deposit Prediction](#project4)
 * [Insurance Assessment and Risk Prediction](#project5)
 * [Predicting Cummulative Temperature Using ARIMA](#project6)
